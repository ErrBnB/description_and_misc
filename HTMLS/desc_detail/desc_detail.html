We are about 10 degrees cooler than sea level which makes for absolutely comfortable days (70-80 degrees) and GREAT temps for sleeping (usually in the 60's). This is the MAXIMUM elevation you can stay and still go scuba diving on Maui. Speaking of diving...we are avid divers and can assist you booking Scuba Diving with the best dive operation on Maui.</span></span></p>

(180 pounds)...not a barker, super sweet. We also have 4 cats on the property but no animals are inside the cottage. There are wild chickens and roosters and cows on the property across the stream. Please keep in mind that this is a jungle environment and it is nearly impossible to keep all insects out of any accommodation in Hawaii unless we poison the place. If you are phobic of insects, the jungle will not be your best bet. Gecko lizards are also common inside the houses here.</span></span></p>
